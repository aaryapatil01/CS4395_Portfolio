# Summary

I really enjoyed taking NLP this semester with Professor Mazidi. I got to learn a large variety of NLP techniques, some of which include parsing, text classification, and information extraction. I plan on using this knowledge in future projects as well as in any future employment opportunities. I know that this is a rapidly changing field, so I plan on taking online courses to stay up-to-date with any new advancements.
