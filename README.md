# CS4395_Portfolio
This is a portfolio for my CS 4395 (Human Language Technologies) class.

## Portfolio Assignment 0: Getting Started
This is our intro assignment. 

You can access the paper [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%200/Overview_of_NLP_Aarya_Patil.pdf).

## Portfolio Assignment 1: Text Processing with Python
This is our first assignment. We had to code a program to read, process, and print out data from a csv file.

You can access my code [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/main.py) and the document explaining it more in depth [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%201/Assignment_1_Text_Processing_Explanation.pdf).

## Portfolio Chapter 5: Word Guess Game (Assignment 2)
This is our second assignment. We had to analyze text from a file and then create a word guessing game using the top 50 most common nouns from the file.

You can access my code [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%202/main.py).

## Portfolio Assignment: WordNet (Assignment 3)
This is our third assignment. We had to use WordNet and SentiWordNet to do analysis on different words and sentences.

You can access my python notebook [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%203/HLT_WordNet.pdf).

## Portfolio Assignment: Sentence Parsing (Assignment 4)
This is our fourth assignment. We had to use 3 different types of parsing methods on a sample sentence of our choice. 

You can access my document [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%204/Sentence_Parsing_Aarya_Patil.pdf).

## Portfolio Chapter 8: Ngrams (Assignment 5)
This is our fifth assignment. We worked in teams of 2 to build 3 language models (English, French, and Italian) from N-grams. We wrote one program to pickle the language model dictionaries and another program to unpack them, since that process can be very time consuming when written in one program. 

You can access my first program [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%205/program_1.py) and my second program [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%205/program_1.py). You can also access our document discussing N-grams [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%205/Overview_of_Ngrams.pdf).

## Portfolio: Finding or Building a Corpus (Assignment 6)
This is our sixth assignment. We worked in teams of 2 to build a web crawler and do web scraping with Beautiful Soup and other APIs.

You can access my code [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%206/main.py) and the document explaining it more in depth [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%206/Overview_of_Corpus_Creation.pdf).

## Portfolio Assignment: Text Classification (Assignment 7)
This is our seventh assignment. We had to find a text classification data set and perform Na√Øve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Neural Networks algorithms on the data. 

You can access my python notebook [here](https://github.com/aaryapatil01/CS4395_Portfolio/blob/main/Assignment%207/HLT_Text_Classification.pdf).
